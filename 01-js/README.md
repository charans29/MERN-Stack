## JavaScript Assignments

I've been provided empty JavaScript files (or having function signatures) in this directory. 
I followed the instructions given in each file and written the code in the same file to complete the assignment.

### Assignments
Feel freed to start doing these in any order I like.
1. Easy
2. Medium
3. Hard

## Testing
1. Followed the comment above each problem to run test for that problem
3. To tests for all the problems of this week run ```npx jest ./tests/```

#### Development Setup
1. As I have Node.js locally, I ran these on my machine 
2. Else copy these over to repl.it and run there. Since Tests wont be automated there have to make use judgement to ensure code is correct
